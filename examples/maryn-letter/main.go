    Recently I have been working on a fun project that allows me to make
printed circuit boards to try out experiments. In the process, I needed
to be able to draw letters on the boards so I wrote some code that let me
use different fonts (which are collections of letters that use the same
style). This paragraph uses a font called "Sofia Regular" which I thought
you might like.`
	msg2 = `
    This letter was written to you using that code. I'm changing the font
so that you can see different styles of writing. This font is called
"Spirax Regular". I didn't actually need different font colors for my
printed circuit boards, but I thought you might like to see the letters in
different colors, so I modified the code to let me draw with colors.`
	msg3 = `
    This font is called "Top Secret Bold". It only has
upper-case letters in it, unfortunately.`
	msg4 = `
    On the second page, I'll print out a copy of the code that I used to
"render" (which just means "to draw") this letter. The programming
language that I used to write the code is called Go. It is one of my
favorite programming languages. I enjoy learning different programming
languages just for fun. Some people probably think that is weird! Right
now I'm reading about a language called "Nim". This is a fun font
called "Tangerine Bold".`
	msg5 = `
    There are even fonts that render musical notes, like this one which
is called "Type My Music Notation":`
	msg6 = `
    12345678`
	msg7 = `
    Some fonts just have pretty pictures. Here is one of those that
is called "Printers Ornaments One":`

    If you ever want to learn more about programming, I'm always happy
to talk about it, or anything else you want to talk about.`
